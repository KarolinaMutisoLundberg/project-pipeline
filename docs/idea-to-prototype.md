# From Idea to Prototype

1. **Brainstorming**
   - Collect ideas as a group
   - Focus on problem-solving and user value

2. **Define scope**
   - What is the Minimum Viable Product (MVP)?
   - Which features are "must-have" vs "nice-to-have"?

3. **User stories**
   - Describe how a user interacts with the app
   - Example: "As a user, I want to log in so I can save my progress."

4. **Wireframes / sketches**
   - Use Figma (or similar) to create low-fidelity wireframes
   - Define basic flow between screens

5. **Data model**
   - What data do we need?
   - Draft API endpoints and database structure (even if just dummy data for now)

6. **Decide workflow**
   - Dummy data first or connect to backend right away?
   - Agree on naming conventions for API routes and components

7. **Setup tasks**
   - Divide responsibilities (frontend/backend/design)
   - Document decisions in `docs/`
